# AutoBackup

A program designed for backing up frequently-changing data, AutoBackup can copy and zip up a folder, and put it in a separate location with a timestamped name.
Additionally, it supports uploading these files to Google Drive, if you can set up the appropriate access permissions and add a client key. The program is meant 
to be launched by placing it in the startup folder in Windows, and you can add, remove, or change backups by using AutoBackupGUI.py, which launches a tkinter
GUI for editing any of the folders to be backed up.
